                Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, 
                for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. 
                By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the 
                level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was 
                dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense 
                dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down 
                into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through 
                a rift in the clouds.
